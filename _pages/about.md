Thanks for visiting my page!

hi!
======

I’m Maiara — a Biomedical Engineer from UFPE and currently a Master’s student in Computer Science at PUC-Rio. My research sits at the intersection of **neuroscience, language, and AI**, and I’m especially fascinated by how the brain transforms symbols, meanings, and actions into complex linguistic behavior.

I’m currently investigating **how the brain represents and produces language** — not just perception, but also the internal processes of language production, acquisition, and even motor patterns that emerge when we think, plan, or structure language. My work uses machine learning to uncover how semantic, syntactic, and sensorimotor components are encoded in neural activity, particularly EEG.

I’m developing a more human-centered and explainable framework that goes beyond standard brain-decoding pipelines. Instead of treating language as a single “black box” representation, I’m creating models that disentangle semantic meaning, syntactic structure, and sensorimotor features, shedding light on how these layers interact during language production and learning.

I’m also building an interactive interface so neuroscientists, clinicians, and educators can explore these neural–linguistic representations in a transparent and intuitive way — supporting new applications in human–machine interaction, assistive communication, and language learning technologies.

Some of the questions guiding my work include:

***How is language represented — and produced — in the brain?***

***How does the brain articulate semantic content differently from syntactic or motor features?***

***How can AI help us understand how humans acquire language and structure concepts?***

***How can we build models that improve decoding while remaining interpretable and aligned with cognitive science?***

In short: I’m exploring how brains build and use language — and how AI can help us reveal the structure behind these processes. If you’re interested in language, cognition, neural signals, or the messy beauty of how humans use language to think, learn and express ideas, I’m always excited to chat :)
