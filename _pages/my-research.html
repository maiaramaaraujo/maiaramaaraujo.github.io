# Research Overview

My research explores how the brain represents, processes, and produces language, with a focus on neural dynamics measured through EEG. I work at the intersection of **neuroscience, language science, artificial intelligence, and human–machine interaction (HMI)**, aiming to uncover how different linguistic layers — semantic, syntactic, and sensorimotor — emerge in neural activity.

## 🔬 Current Themes

### **1. Neural encoding of language**
I investigate how different components of language (meaning, structure, and articulatory/motor patterns) are reflected in brain activity during comprehension and production.

### **2. Machine learning + EEG**
I develop ML models that decode linguistic or cognitive states from EEG signals, focusing on:
- Representation learning  
- Contrastive learning  
- Explainable AI (XAI)  
- Model interpretability for clinicians and neuroscientists

## 🧠 Human-centered Explainable AI
I work on frameworks that move beyond the “black box” approach to brain decoding, creating transparent models that clinicians and researchers can interpret and trust.

## 🗂 Ongoing Projects

- Semantic and syntactic feature decoding from EEG  
- Explainability for phonological-category classification  
- Multimodal imagined-speech decoding  
- Cognitive biases and language processing in complex decision tasks
